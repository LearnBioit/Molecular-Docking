                                                    ********MOLECULAR DOCKING**********

""" THEORY """
What?: The interaction between the target and ligand (e.g. Key-keyHole/Hand-Glove)
Why?: To perform in silico studies for interaction
How?: Using various tools

Docking is the concept where tools are decided on the basis of input that you are working with: 
There are n numbers tools available for e.g.

Protein Small molecules:  Autodock tools, SCRO, DS,..
Protein-Protein: PATCHDOCK, ZDOCK, HADDOCK, HEX, ClusPro
Protein-Small Molecules (Ligands): Autodock (1 protein and 1 ligand), Vina (1 protein and multiple ligands)
Protein Molecules + Cofactors: SCRO (GLIDE)
Protein-Peptide: PATCHDOCK
Antigen-Antibody: PATCHDOCK
Protein-Peptide (very small molecules): Autodock tools, Vina, PATCHDOCK
Protein small molecules (PT/CD): Autodock tools
Peptide Peptide: CRANKPEP
Covalent Docking: ADFG
HRDRATE DOCKING: SUIT OF ADFR

************AUTODOCK TOOLS***********
----------------------------------------------------------

*********AUTODOCK TOOLS***********
TO PEROFRM AUTODOCK TOOLS WE NEED:
1. Target- PROTEIN/LOCK/HOST
----Identification-Literature
---Prediction---??
this is the conditon in which you hava a moleucle with you, this can also be done with literature or if not then:
----server--Swisstarget etc,

2. Ligand: Guest/small molecules/ HITS/POT/NOVEL/
-------PHARMACOPHORE BASED HITS
-------STRUCTURAL SIMILARITY BASED HITS
-------NOVEL MOLEULE
-------PREDICTION/HYPOTHESIS
3. Active site(KEYHOLE): Binding site and catalytic site:
 -------------lITERATURE, PREDICTION, SEQ ALIGNMENT.......


#NOTE: (BEFORE YOU WERE PERFORMING THE DOCKING, YOU MUST MEET THE CRITERIA, LIKE: PROTEIN, LIGAND AND ACTIVE SITE OF THE PROTEIN)
a. Protein ------ Protein.pdb
b. ligand ------- ligand.sdf
c. Active site: lit, ligplot (x, y, and z co-ordinates)

#The Procedure of the Docking:

*********************Pre Autodock tools steps*************************
A. Target Preparation- protein.pdb---clean the files, removal of heteroatoms, unwanted chains by using Discovery studio, grep, text editors etc.

 This can be done by the following general procedure:
'''Discovery Studio Visualizer'''
      Open the PDB or protein file in Discovery Studio Visualizer by selecting Open then File.
      Remove heteroatoms such as water molecules, sulphate, phosphate, solvents, ions, salts 
      like Ca, Mg, etc.
      If the protein has two or more identical chains, keep only one chain.
      Go to Scripts → Ligand Interactions → Show Ligand Binding Site Atoms.
      Right-click → Label → Residue.
      Find the bonds attached to the native ligand and amino acids.
      Make a note of these interactions.
      Delete the ligand and save the file in the protein.pdb format.




B. ligand Preparation- ligand.sdf --- Energy Minimization by using of Marvin tools
 the ligand of 2D sdf file can be changed  into 3D sdf file as follows;
        Go to Edit- open sdf file.
        Again go to Edit - clean- 2D
        Edit - clean - 3D
        Save as sybl mol2 format.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***************In Autodock tools steps*****************
1. Target/Protein
       Go to File --- Read Molecule - open protein.pdb
       Go to Edit --- Hydrogens - Add- Polar only.
       Go to file --- Save - Write PDB - OK
       Delete moleule

2. ligand Preparation
        Go to ligand - Input - Open (lidand.mol2)
        Go to ligand - Torsion Tree - Direct Root
        Go to ligand - Torsion Tree - Show Root Expansion
        Go to ligand - Torsion Tree - Choose torsions
        Go to ligand - Torsion Tree- Set number of torsions
        Go to ligand - Output - save as pdbqt (ligand.pdbqt)
   Delete molecule.

3.Grid Preparation
        Go to Grid - Macromolecule - Open
        In here, the macromolecule (i.e pdb file will be converted into the pdbqt file 
        inside the same path of the pdb file.
        Add atoms types as, 
        Select Gird - Set Map types - Directly - A C H Cl Br I F S P HD N NA OA SA 
        (Altogether 14 map types)
        Grid - Grid Box: Enter your Center Grid Box Below: ( An active Site data), and Upper 
        Number of points in x, y and z to reach to 60 60 60 respectively.
        Go to file- Close saving current
        Go to Grid - Output - Save GPF proteinname.gpf

In this way the GPF file is created for the particular protein.

4. Docking file Preparation
   Go to Docking - Macromolecule - set rigid filename (open protein.pdbqt)
   Go to Docking - Ligand - Open ( Open ligand.pdbqt)
   Go to Docking -Search parameters - Genetic algorithms - Accept
   Go to Docking - Docking - Lamarckcian GA - save dpf (lignand.dpf)

  *********************Performing Docking*************************
  * Running the grid: Autogrid -p protein.gpf -l protein.glg     *
  * Running the Docking: Autodock4 -p ligand.dpf -l ligand.dlg   *
